        <p>This website is based on the work made by <a href="https://twitter.com/@antonmc">Anton McConville</a> and his analysis of <a href="http://ziggy.mybluemix.net">David Bowie lyrics.</a></p>
        <div id="littlewonder" class="littlewonder"><strong>THE ORIGINAL PROJECT: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Wonder_(song)">LITTLE WONDER</a></strong></div>
        <p>The original project began as a personal way of remembering David Bowie, absorbing and reflecting his seasons and songs, but turned into an experiment to share.</p>
        <p>It is most of all <strong>an examination of personas</strong> using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">big five personality traits</a>. David Bowie continually changed, gifting us many new characters and incredible songs, during a beloved career.</p>
        <p> The objective of the project is to see if there is a <strong>correlation between his written lyrics and his visual personas.</strong></p>
        <p>We take the lyrics from albums that correspond to each persona/period and run <a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/personality-insights.html"> Watson Personality Insights</a> on them. </p>

        <p>Clicking on one of the pictures of an artist on the <a href="..">main page</a> opens another page that looks like a mock Twitter account for each persona. The 'tweets' contain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram">sankey diagrams</a> that break down the big five personality traits and a little bar chart that shows the combined trait measurements.</p>
        <p>Each page has a video embedded, and has links to wikipedia articles about the albums from that persona. Listen to the music, follow the album links, read the personality data. How does the data correspond to that persona?</p>
        <p>Displaying this as a Twitter page was a design idea to emphasize the theme of persona. This project considers changes too - it wants to reflect on changes in persona visually and through mining the data within the songs over time.</p>
        <p>From the main view you can also find a link to <a href="comparison.html">a page which shows the big five traits over time</a>, and per persona.</p>
        <p> There are also controls to toggle between the contributing sub-traits. This view shows how we can track personality over time.</p>
